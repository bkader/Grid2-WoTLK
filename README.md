# Grid2 r733 (_WoTLK_)

Grid2 is a party/raid unit frame addon.

Grid2 is fully customizable. New zones (indicators) can be defined in unit frames to display information (statuses). The indicators can be customized and placed anywhere. Grid2 supports several types of indicators: icon, icons, square, text, bar, multibar. You can configure what statuses are displayed on each indicator.

Grid2 includes a huge amount of available statuses, but not all enabled by default, look through the configuration and familiarize yourself with the available options and statuses.

Grid2 is fast: consumes between 4 and 10 times less CPU cycles than other similar addons.

To open the configuration UI type "/grid2" or left-click the minimap Icon.
